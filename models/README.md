This folder contains the trained models, that can be directly used to generate the forecast for the test set.

For TabM we saved 5 different versions corresponding to 5 different seeds (as neural networks are not deterministic).

We could not save the fitted TabPFN model is it is too big for gitHub (>100Mb).

The code used to fit all these models is saved in ./src/train_models.py
